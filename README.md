The Design specifications of the OTA are as follows
1. **DC Gain:**
   - Target: ≥ 60 dB.

2. **-3 dB Bandwidth:**
   - Target: ≥ 10 kHz.

3. **Input Referred Noise:**
   - Target: ≤ 2 µVrms.

4. **Common Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR):**
   - Target: ≥ 100 dB.

5. **Noise Efficiency Factor (NEF):**
   - Target: ≤ 4.

6. **DC Power Consumption:**
   - Target: ≤ 30 µA.

7. **Supply Voltage:**
   - Target: ≤ 1.8 V.

The uploaded document(Report.pdf), has all the hand calculations and simulation results for operating point, STB analysis, slew rate, settling time, systematic offset, noise, cmrr, psrr, input common-mode range, closed loop gain, closed loop transient analysis, power consumption. The report also includes the design of a pseudo resistor which is used for the neural amplifier design.

The amplifiers have been designed and simulated in LTSpice, the simulation files are uploaded in the ``` /simulations ``` folder
